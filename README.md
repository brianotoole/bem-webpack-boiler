# BEM Webpack Boiler
A minimalistic boilerplate that follows BEM methodology and organizes assets using an SMACSS approach. It comes with Webpack that includes BrowserSync for auto reloading / proxing a server, Babel for writing ES6-based javascript modules, Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility, and uses SCSS as the main loader for styles.

## Requirements
To use everything this boilerplate ships with, you need the following installed on your machine:

* NPM

## Installation
1. Clone the repository & cd into the site's directory
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/brianotoole/bem-webpack-boiler.git
cd bem-webpack-boiler
```

2. Install npm dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```
3. *Optional:* Change proxy location for BrowserSync
If you'd like to change the name of your site's folder, open `webpack.config.js` file and change the proxy location for BrowserSync to work. On ~line 36:

Change proxy location: "localhost/bem-webpack-boiler"
``` bash
proxy: 'localhost/Your-New-Site-Name', 
```

4. Start server
The boilerplate comes preset with css/js file inclusions, base meta settings, and a basic semantic body with a few modules to get you started. However, to make full use of the site-start though, you'll want to use Webpack.

``` bash
npm run-script watch
```

This will open up a browser window with local site and watch for file changes. Ex - http://localhost:3000/bem-webpack-boiler

### Build files for production
When you're ready to minify production files, run the following in the site's root:
``` bash
npm run-script prod
```

This will run webpack's production build flag, `-p` to minify bundled files.

### Local Images and Fonts
Webpack needs a few loaders installed to use local images/fonts within the project's directory. This boilerplate uses `url-loader` to bundle/load images. Url-loader has the ability to load files as base64 encoded DataURL if the file is smaller than a specificied byte limit. This helps reduce the number of requests made. 

##### URL-Loader webpack setup
The default specificed byte limit on this boilerplate to serve DataURL's on images is 10KB, or 10,000 bytes. There are 2 separate url-loader options to test for. 

**1. Test for image files**
``` javascript
{ // URL LOADER, IMAGE FILES
  test: /\.(jpe?g|png|svg)/,
  loader: 'url-loader?limit=10000&name=dist/img/[name].[ext]', //if < 10 kb, base64 encode img to css
},
```
This is testing for files with `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.svg` extention types. If the file is less than 10KB, serve this as a DataURL. If greater than 10KB, bundle to the path within `&name`. Or, `./dist/img/[name].[ext]`.

**2. Test for font files**
``` javascript
{ // URL LOADER, FONTS
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf)/,
  loader: 'url-loader?limit=10000&name=dist/fonts/[name].[ext]', //font files to './dist/fonts/**.'
},
```
This is testing for files with `.woff/.woff2/.eot/.ttf` extention types. If the file is less than 10KB, serve this as a DataURL. If greater than 10KB, bundle to the path within `&name`. Or, `./dist/fonts/[name].[ext]`.

##### Using Images in Stylesheet
Add images within the `./src/img/` folder.
To use the image within a stylesheet, use the relative path from the main entrypoint file, `./src/index.js`. An example:
``` css
.--has-bg { background: url('../img/bg-brick.png') 0 0 repeat; }
```

##### File-loader fallback
If for some reason url-loader isn't your preferred loader, file-loader is installed and setup within webpack.config.js. To use, uncomment the `file-loader` within `webpack.config.js` and comment-out or remove the url-loader instance.

### Packages Included
1. [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)
will use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to automatically apply prefixes. This requires the [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) loader to be installed & used within `webpack.config.js` file. This is already setup and includes the `postcss.config` file needed to work. See the postcss-loader [documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) for dealing with browser support / options.


2. Babel: [babel-core](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) and [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) are used with the [Babel-Preset-ES2015](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015-webpack) preset. This preset is used to enable code to be written in ES2015 (ES6) and compiled for browser support down to ES5.

3. [BrowserSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync-webpack-plugin): 
This boiler is using BrowserSync to serve the project and Webpack Dev Server is not needed. The setup is pretty easy: just pass the BrowserSync options to the plugin as the first argument within the `webpack.config.js` file.


### Dependencies Included
1. [jQuery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) is included as dependency to grab/manipulate DOM elements with ease. You are able to use jQuery within any javascript file, by importing `$ from jquery` into the file, like so:
``` javascript 
import $ from 'jquery'; 
```

2. [Lazysizes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazysizes) is similar to Lazyload. It is a self-initializing lazyloader for images and still works fine for SEO, since it does not hide images/assets from search engines... No matter what markup pattern you use. This package is included as a dependency. 

To lazyload images, add the class `.lazyload` to all `img` and `iframe` elements, as needed. Instead of a `src` or `srcset` attribute **use a `data-src` or `data-srcset` attribute**. Here's an example:
``` html
<img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
```

## TODO
- [ ] Add modernizr / setup basic fallback classes for IE9
- [X] Add url-loader / setup local images/font paths
- [X] Add production build script: on run-script 'build prod', compress images + min assets
- [ ] Include base icon set
